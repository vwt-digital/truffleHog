HEADS UP

Right now a breaking change in GitPython is causing an error in pip installations. I will get this working asap, but in the mean time, the docker image has a temperary fix and you can find it here https://hub.docker.com/r/dxa4481/trufflehog

# truffleHog
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dxa4481/truffleHog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dxa4481/truffleHog)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dxa4481/truffleHog/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dxa4481/truffleHog)

Searches through git repositories for secrets, digging deep into commit history and branches. This is effective at finding secrets accidentally committed.

## NEW
truffleHog previously functioned by running entropy checks on git diffs. This functionality still exists, but high signal regex checks have been added, and the ability to surpress entropy checking has also been added.


```
truffleHog --regex --entropy=False https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog.git
```

or

```
truffleHog file:///user/dxa4481/codeprojects/truffleHog/
```

With the `--include_paths` and `--exclude_paths` options, it is also possible to limit scanning to a subset of objects in the Git history by defining regular expressions (one per line) in a file to match the targeted object paths. To illustrate, see the example include and exclude files below:

_include-patterns.txt:_
```ini
src/
# lines beginning with "#" are treated as comments and are ignored
gradle/
# regexes must match the entire path, but can use python's regex syntax for
# case-insensitive matching and other advanced options
(?i).*\.(properties|conf|ini|txt|y(a)?ml)$
(.*/)?id_[rd]sa$
```

_exclude-patterns.txt:_
```ini
(.*/)?\.classpath$
.*\.jmx$
(.*/)?test/(.*/)?resources/
```

These filter files could then be applied by:
```bash
trufflehog --include_paths include-patterns.txt --exclude_paths exclude-patterns.txt file://path/to/my/repo.git
```
With these filters, issues found in files in the root-level `src` directory would be reported, unless they had the `.classpath` or `.jmx` extension, or if they were found in the `src/test/dev/resources/` directory, for example. Additional usage information is provided when calling `trufflehog` with the `-h` or `--help` options.

These features help cut down on noise, and makes the tool easier to shove into a devops pipeline.

## Install
```
pip install truffleHog
```

## Customizing

Custom regexes can be added with the following flag `--rules /path/to/rules`. This should be a json file of the following format:
```
{
    "RSA private key": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
```
Things like subdomain enumeration, s3 bucket detection, and other useful regexes highly custom to the situation can be added.

Feel free to also contribute high signal regexes upstream that you think will benefit the community. Things like Azure keys, Twilio keys, Google Compute keys, are welcome, provided a high signal regex can be constructed.

trufflehog's base rule set sources from https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHogRegexes/blob/master/truffleHogRegexes/regexes.json

## How it works
This module will go through the entire commit history of each branch, and check each diff from each commit, and check for secrets. This is both by regex and by entropy. For entropy checks, truffleHog will evaluate the shannon entropy for both the base64 char set and hexidecimal char set for every blob of text greater than 20 characters comprised of those character sets in each diff. If at any point a high entropy string >20 characters is detected, it will print to the screen.
